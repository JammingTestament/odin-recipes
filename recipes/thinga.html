    <h4>
        Enchiladas Suizas, a classic Mexico City dish, features chicken enchiladas in a creamy, tangy tomatillo and chile sauce topped with melted cheese. 
    </h4>
    <p>
        We quickly poached strips of boneless chicken in broth (heavy on Knorr Pollo) for tender, juicy meat seasoned with black pepper and Mexican oregano.<br> 
        The sauce combines simmered tomatillos, onion, garlic, and serrano chiles, blended with cilantro and crema Salvadore√±a for freshness and richness.<br> 
        Lightly frying corn tortillas made them pliable and resistant to moisture. After rolling, the enchiladas were sauced, topped with cheese, and briefly cooked in the same skillet, with extra sauce served on the side.

        Steps
        <h5>
            For the Chicken üêîüçó
        </h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring 2¬Ω cups water, chicken, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and peppercorns to simmer in medium saucepan over high heat.</li> 
                <li>Reduce heat to maintain simmer and cook until chicken registers 160 degrees, 5 to 7 minutes.</li> 
                <li>Transfer chicken to bowl and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 5 minutes (strain broth and reserve for other use).</li> 
                <li>Shred chicken into ¬Ω-inch pieces.</li>
            </ol>
        <h5>
            For the Sauce üî• 
        </h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut 1 serrano in half lengthwise and scrape out seeds. Transfer serrano halves to medium saucepan along with remaining 2 whole serranos. Halve onion. Cut one ¬Ω-inch-thick slice from 1 onion half; add to saucepan with serranos. </li>
                <li>Finely chop remaining onion half and set aside for serving. Add tomatillos and garlic to saucepan.</li>
                <li>Add water to cover vegetables and bring to gentle simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to maintain very gentle simmer and cook until tomatillos are very tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Using slotted spoon, transfer onion, garlic, serranos, and one-quarter of tomatillos to blender. Add cilantro, sugar, salt and blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Add remaining tomatillos (discard cooking water) and 1/4 lb of crema salvadore≈Ña and blend until smooth, 45 to 60 seconds.</li>
             </ol>
        <h5>
            Construct the Enchiladas üçΩÔ∏è 
        </h5>  
            <ol> 
                <li>Line rimmed baking sheet with double layer of paper towels. Heat oil in 10-inch ovensafe skillet over medium heat to 325 degrees. Using tongs, place 1 tortilla in skillet and fry for 5 seconds.Flip tortilla and continue to cook until it is puffed in spots but not browned, 4 to 6 seconds longer. Transfer to prepared sheet. Repeat with remaining tortillas. Place double layer of paper towels over tortillas and press to absorb excess oil. Discard oil and wipe out skillet.</li>
                <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Add oregano to chicken and toss to combine. Season with pepper to taste. Spread ¬º cup sauce across bottom of now-empty skillet.</li>
                <li>Place ¬º cup chicken over lower third of 1 tortilla. Roll tortilla tightly around filling and place seam side down in skillet. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling. (Arrange 6 enchiladas down center of skillet and one on each side). Spread ‚Öì cup sauce evenly over enchiladas. Sprinkle Monterey Jack evenly over sauce. Bake until cheese is melted and filling is heated through (internal temperature should be between 135 and 140 degrees), about 12 minutes.</li>
                <li>While enchiladas bake, transfer remaining sauce to saucepan and bring to gentle simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Divide sauce evenly among 4 shallow bowls. Arrange 2 enchiladas in each bowl, over sauce. Garnish enchiladas with cilantro, radish, cotija, and reserved chopped onion. Serve immediately.</li>
